# Dad Shift

*A short, narrative-driven game about being a new father.*

---

## 🎮 Overview

**Dad Shift** is a small, story-focused game about the first days of caring for a newborn — told from the perspective of a father who is also trying to keep his job.

The game is not about winning or optimizing stats.
It is about making imperfect choices while tired, stressed, and still showing up.

Playtime per run is **~40–50 minutes**, with multiple endings encouraging replay. Total content is designed for **2–3 hours**.

---

## 🧠 Core Themes

- Newborn care is repetitive, exhausting, and emotionally subtle
- Work does not pause when life changes
- Small decisions can echo later
- Being present matters, even when nothing improves immediately

The tone is **light, dry, and gently humorous**, avoiding melodrama or moral judgment.

---

## 🕒 Structure

- **5 in-game days**
- Each day has **3 phases**:
  - Morning
  - Afternoon
  - Night

Each phase presents a short narrative event with choices that affect the game state.

## 📊 Core Systems

### Stats

- **Energy** – physical and mental stamina
- **Stress** – accumulated pressure
- **Bond** – emotional connection with the baby
- **Job Stability** – work performance and security
- **Confidence** – self-perception as a parent

There is no perfect balance. Every choice trades something away.

---

## 🧩 Narrative Design

- Events are short, text-driven, and grounded in everyday situations
- Consequences are often delayed or understated
- The game avoids explicit "good" or "bad" labels

Some endings are intentionally uncomfortable — not because of tragedy, but because of absence.

---

## 🔚 Endings

The game features **multiple endings**, including:

- Still Awake
- Functional Adult
- Present Father
- On Autopilot
- The Quiet Mistake
- It Gets Easier (hidden)

Endings reflect *how* you lived through the days, not how well you optimized them.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- Engine: **Godot 4.x**
- Platform: PC (initially)
- Style: Minimal UI, text-focused

## 📌 Design Philosophy

> This game is not about being a good or bad parent.
>
> It is about being there — or not — when it mattered.

## 🚧 Project Status

This project is in **design-first development**.

All narrative structure, systems, and endings are defined **before** implementation.

See `TODO.md` for the current design and implementation checklist.
